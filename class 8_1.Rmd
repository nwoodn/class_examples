This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}

# Do scatterplot matrix of data (see lab 6-1 if need help)

# Next fit a logistic regression model on the BoxOffice variable
# This asks whether or not the chances of winning an Oscar are 
# related to the the amount of money the film makes.
boxOfficeModel <- glm ( Oscar ~ BoxOffice, data=filmData, family=binomial(link="logit"))

# use mod_plot on the model
# look how it nicely does all the logit converting for us
# and plots the probability
mod_plot(boxOfficeModel, data=filmData)


```
```{r}
# To assess the success of our model, let's look at how well
# it predicts Oscar success.  First we pull the predicted logit
# scores out of our favoured model.
oscarLogits = augment(boxOfficeModel, filmData)

ggplot(data=oscarLogits, aes(x=BoxOffice, y=.fitted)) + geom_point()

ggplot(data=oscarLogits, aes(x=BoxOffice, y=.resid)) + geom_point()

hist(oscarLogits$.resid )


# make residuals plot
binnedplot(oscarLogits$.fitted ,oscarLogits$.resid,
    xlab="Expected Values", ylab="Average residual", 
    main="Binned residual plot", 
    cex.pts=0.8, col.pts=1, col.int="gray")
mod_plot(boxOfficeModel)

# Now we can use R's handy ifelse command to set a new variable
# "oscarPredictions" to 1 if the logit score is greater than 0,
# and to 0 if the logit score is lower than 0.  Recall that a 
# logit score of 0 corresponds to a probability of 0.5.
oscarPredictions = ifelse(oscarLogits > 0,1,0)

# Making a table of actual v. predicted Oscar success shows us
# that our model gets 215 films right and 85 films wrong.
# Better than guessing though!
table(oscarPredictions,Oscar)



# Now fit the full model, i.e., predicting a film's Oscar 
# winning chances based on all five of the available 
# predictor variables.
fullModel = glm( Oscar ~ BoxOffice + Budget + Country + Critics + Length, data = filmData, family=binomial(link="logit"))
summary(fullModel)

exp(fullModel$coefficients)

mod_plot(fullModel)


# Here's another dataset with a logistic model
mod2 <- glm(married ~ age + sex * sector,
data = mosaicData::CPS85, family=binomial(link="logit"))

# plot the model and interpret it, what do the visualizations
# say about the relationships

```

```{r}

# How do we go from a prediction of the probability, to 
# actually making a prediction of oscar or not?

# To assess the success of our model, let's look at how well
# it predicts Oscar success.  First we pull the predicted logit
# scores out of our favoured model.
oscarLogits = predict(fullModel)

# Now we can use R's handy ifelse command to set a new variable
# "oscarPredictions" to 1 if the logit score is greater than 0,
# and to 0 if the logit score is lower than 0.  Recall that a 
# logit score of 0 corresponds to a probability of 0.5.
oscarPredictions = ifelse(oscarLogits > 0,1,0)

# Making a table of actual v. predicted Oscar success shows us
# that our model gets 215 films right and 85 films wrong.
# Better than guessing though!
table(oscarPredictions,Oscar)

# Try different cutoffs for the logit score, search over them
# to find one with better performance 

```
# Residuals for logistic regression

```{r}

# add logistic regression predictions to data
fit <- fullModel
data_fitted <- augment(fit, filmData)

# make residuals plot
binnedplot(data_fitted$.fitted ,data_fitted$.resid,
    xlab="Expected Values", ylab="Average residual", 
    main="Binned residual plot", 
    cex.pts=0.8, col.pts=1, col.int="gray")
mod_plot(fit)


```
# What do residuals look like when model assumptions are met?

```{r}
#generate data using logistic regression model

# read off the coefficient values from the oscars model

# make grid of variable values

# generate data


# plot data


# generate data with residual

# plot data
